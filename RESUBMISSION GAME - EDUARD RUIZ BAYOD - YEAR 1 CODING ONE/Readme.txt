The inspiration from the code has been taken from : 
	
	https://github.com/techwithtim/PygameForBeginners


All the code has been adapted to my own version of the game, as discussed with Agnes on tutorial, as I had submitted already a game I have retyped 
from scratch all the code used trying to understand the process behind.


2 PLAYER BASED GAME:

- EACH PLAYER STAND ON ONE SIDE OF THE SCREEN
- BOTTOM PLAYER MOVES USING W-A-S-D KEYS AND SHOOTS BULLETS WITH LEFT-ALT KEY.
- TOP PLAYER MOVES USING ARROW KEYS AND SHOOTS BULLETS USING RIGHT-ALT KEY.
- AN ASTEROID IN BETWEEN BOTH SIDES, MOVES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AND WHEN BULLETS COLLIDES WITH IT, THE BULLETS DISAPPEAR.
- WHEN PLAYER GETS HIT WITH A BULLET, THE HEALTH BAR GETS DECREASED.
- FIRST PLAYER TO DROP ENEMY'S HEALTH BAR TO 0 WINS, AND GAME GETS RESTARTED.
- SOUNDS ARE PLAYED WHEN:
	A. PLAYER FIRE BULLETS
	B. PLAYER GETS HIT BY A BULLET OR 2 BULLETS COLLIDES BETWEEN THEM
	C. WHEN A PLAYER WINS THE GAME
